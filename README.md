## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed

cd abdo-calculator


### Notes:
1. Replace placeholder text (like `yourusername`) with your actual details
2. Add actual screenshots by:
   - Taking screenshots of your calculator
   - Saving as `screenshot.png` in the project folder
   - Uncommenting the image line

3. For a more professional touch, you could add:
   - Badges (e.g., Python version, license)
   - CI/CD status if you set up automated testing
   - More detailed development documentation

4. The markdown assumes your main file is named `calculator.py` - adjust if you used a different name.
